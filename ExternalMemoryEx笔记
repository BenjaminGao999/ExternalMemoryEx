1、https://source.android.com/devices/storage/

Android has evolved over time to support a wide variety of storage device types and features.
All versions of Android support devices with traditional storage, which includes portable and emulated storage.
Portable storage can be provided by physical media, like an SD card or USB, that is for temporary data transfer/ file storage.
 The physical media may remain with the device for an extended period of time, but is not tied to the device and may be removed.
 SD cards have been available as portable storage since Android 1.0; Android 6.0 added USB support.

 1）Emulated storage is provided by exposing a portion of internal storage through an emulation layer and has been available since Android 3.0.

Starting in Android 6.0, Android supports adoptable storage, which is provided by physical media, like an SD card or USB,
that is encrypted and formatted to behave like internal storage. Adoptable storage can store all types of application data.

Some devices (like my Nexus 4) don't have an external slot for an SD Card.
Instead, there's a root folder called /sdcard/ that is treated the same way.
But I also find other paths that all point to the same files --
there must be some kind redirects going on (I think this is called symlinks in Linux).

All these paths contain the same files:
/sdcard/
/storage/sdcard0/
/storage/emulated/0/
/storage/emulated/legacy/

Which path is the "actual" one? What about the other paths? What are they used for, why do they exist?

That has to do with the Multi-User feature enabled with JellyBean 4.2 (not 4.1).
In order to handle separate accounts, parts of the directory structure had to be changed.
/sdcard/legacy e.g. always points to the currently logged-in user's sd card directory.

/storage/emulated/0
The "/storage/emulated/" folder does not really exist.
 It's what might be called a "symbolic link", or, in simpler terms, a reference to where the real data is stored.
 You'll need to find the actual physical location on your device where it is stored.

4、
getExternalFilesDir
This is like getFilesDir() in that these files will be deleted when the application is uninstalled,
 however there are some important differences:
1）Shared storage may not always be available, since removable media can be ejected by the user. Media state can be checked using getExternalStorageState(File).
2）There is no security enforced with these files. For example, any application holding WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE can write to these files.
